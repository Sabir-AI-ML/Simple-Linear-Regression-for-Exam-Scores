# Simple Linear Regression Model to predict Exam Scores
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with a Simple Linear Regression Model that predicts Exam Scores based on the number of Hours Studied. The notebook covers data analysis, model building, and evaluation using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and seaborn.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is **Exam Scores.csv**. It contains two columns - Hours Studied and Exam Score, with 308 observations.

## Installation and Usage
To use this notebook, you will need Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries by running **pip install -r requirements.txt** in your terminal.

To open the notebook, run **jupyter notebook** in your terminal and navigate to **Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb**.

## Results
The Simple Linear Regression model achieved a Mean Squared Error of 5.33 and an R-squared score of 0.964 on the test dataset. The model can be used to predict the Exam Score of a student given the number of Hours Studied.
